The goal of planThis is to simplify time keeping in the EA. It uses categorised outlook appointments to create time cards weighted against free time and daily hours. Outputs are suitable for Oracle implementation.

## Installation

You can install the development version of planThis from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JonPayneEA/planThis")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to use the tool. It requires three documents for use;  

  - A daily hours spreadsheet (*.xlsx*)  
  - Categories data (*.csv*)  
  - An exported outlook calendar (*.csv*)  

### Daily hours

The daily hours needs your start time, end time and lunch hours.

Normal work days are set to `Standard`, with this 7.4 hours of work are expected.  A running total of flexi hours is calculated.

Additional options include;  
  - `Weekend` (*0 hrs*)  
  - `Bank Holiday` (*0 hrs*)  
  - `Sick` (*0 hrs*)  
  - `Sick Half` (*3.7 hrs*)  
  - `Leave` (*0 hrs*)  
  - `Leave Half` (*3.7 hrs*)  
  - `Flexi` (*7.4 hrs*)  
  - `Flexi Half` (*3.7 hrs*)

### Categories

Categories data are essential for linking appointments in outlook to a time code.  

Setting this up will be the most time consuming part of the process, however it only need to be done once. In the below pictures the `categories.csv` and outlook colour categories match up.

```{r, echo=FALSE,out.width="49%", out.height="20%",fig.cap="Allignment of categories.csv and colour categories in outlook",fig.show='hold',fig.align='center'}
knitr::include_graphics(c("pics/categoriesCsv.PNG","pics/colourCats.PNG"))
``` 

### Outlook calendar

Now the `categories.csv` and colour categories are set up you will need to organise your outlook calendar.  

Each appointment you wish to have included in time recording requires a category.  
**Anything left blank will not be incorporated.**  

You will need to export your calendar to use it in the tool, this takes seconds to do.

knitr::include_graphics(c("pics/outlookExport1.png","pics/outlookExport2.png"))
``` 


Following installation load the tool with:

```{r example}
